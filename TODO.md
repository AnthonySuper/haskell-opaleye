# High priority

* Make a forked HaskellDB package called haskelldb-opaleye that is
  just for the use of Opaleye
* Manipulation
    * Insert
    * Update
    * Delete

# Low priority

* General type families for improving instance resolution (product-profunctors)

## Good starter projects for someone wanting to contribute to Opaleye

### Very easy

* There are many missing operators that just need to be written down
* Functions for working with Nullable columns
* RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN
* Set operations
    * EXCEPT
    * EXCEPT ALL
    * UNION
    * INTERSECT
    * INTERSECT ALL

### Require a bit of work

* Make VALUES work with more, type checked, value types
* Product-valued case statements
